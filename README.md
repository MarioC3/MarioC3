### Hey there! 👋
### I'm Beto Carlos! 👨🏽‍💻
As a Mexican-born, U.S.-based product-driven innovator, I thrive on crafting ideas and turning them into reality.

With hands-on experience in web development technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, Nuxt, NodeJS, and more, I'm your go-to guy for digital solutions!

Fueled by Pepsi, tamales, and chilorio, my spirit animal is the fierce Charizard, and my inner wizard is a true-blue Ravenclaw.

At the moment, I spearhead Product Engineering at [ShopHero](https://about.shophero.com/)
